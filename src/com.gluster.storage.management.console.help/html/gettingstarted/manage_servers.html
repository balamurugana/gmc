<h1>Managing Your Servers</h1>
A server is a computer or device on a network that manages network
resources. It is a group of linked computers, working together closely
thus in many respects forming a single computer. You can add a new
server to the storage cluster to expand the amount of available storage.
<h2>Server Summary</h2>
<p>The console enables you to monitor your servers in your cluster
from the Summary tab. To display the summary of your cluster, click the
Server node from the left pane of the console window. The summary of the
servers in your cluster is displayed in the right pane of the console
window. It also displays the Tasks and Alerts.</p>
