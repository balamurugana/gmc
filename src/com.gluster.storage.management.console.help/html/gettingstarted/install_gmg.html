<h1>Installing the Gluster Management Gateway</h1>
<p><b>Note:</b> For checking the GlusterFS minimum requirements, refer to the <a href= "http://www.gluster.com/community/documentation/index.php/Gluster_3.2:_Checking_Minimum_Requirements">Gluster 3.2 Filesystem Installation Guide, Checking Minimum Requirements</a>.</p>
<P>You can install the Gluster Management Gateway through the following command:</P>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal and type the following command
<p><FONT FACE = "Courier"># rpm -ivh glustermg-1.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm</FONT>
<li>Start the Gluster Management Gateway by executing the following service
<p><FONT FACE = "Courier"># service tomcat5 start</FONT>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b>
<ul>
<li>You can install the Gluster Management Gateway packages on a Gluster Storage Server. However, this can impact performance of the GlusterFS processes on this machine hence this is not recommended.
<li>The Gluster Management Gateway is shipped with a self-signed SSL certificate, by default. While this ensures that the communication between the console and gateway is encrypted and safe, some browsers may throw security warnings mentioning that the site is not secure. It is highly recommended that you install your own SSL certificate issued by a valid certifying authority in the tomcat5 configuration for the 8443 port.
<li>Enable port 8443 on the Gateway as the Management Console connects to it over SSL on this port
</ul>
<p>Gateway generates SSH keys during installation. These keys are stored in the following location <FONT FACE = "Courier">/opt/glustermg/keys</FONT>. These keys are used for communication with the storage servers. However, in AWS environment, SSH communication is done using the private key provided by Amazon. Hence, the AWS genegrated private key (.pem file) must be stored in <FONT FACE = "Courier">/opt/glustermg/keys</FONT> and the file must be named as <FONT FACE = "Courier">gluster.pem</FONT></p>
