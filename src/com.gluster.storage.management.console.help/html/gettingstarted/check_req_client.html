<h1>Checking the Minimum Requirements of Client Machines</h1>

<p>Verify the following:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 8px;">
<li> Processor - 1.4GHz CPU</li>
<li> Memory - 2 GB RAM</li>
<li> Disk - 100 MB</li>
<li> Operating Systems: Windows XP/Vista/7, Linux, Mac OS X</li>
<li> Oracle JRE 1.6</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web Browser Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use your JRE installer to configure your browser for Java Web Start. Also, ensure that you have configured your browser to open .jnlp files using the Java Web Start application or javaws exe located in bin folder of your JRE installation.
<li>When you access the Gluster Management Console, Java Web Start downloads all required .jar files from the Gateway server and launches the consoleâ€™s GUI. During this process, web start may display a certificate warning mentioning that the application is signed by Gluster, Inc.. This certificate is authentic, but it requires full permissions as the application contains features that require registering information on the client's hard disk such as exporting the security keys from gateway. You can accept the warning and select Always Trust Content from this Provider on your browser to avoid this warning every time you launch the application
