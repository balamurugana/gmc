<h1>CIFS Services</h1>
The Common Internet File System (CIFS), also known as Server Message Block (SMB), is a network protocol whose most common use is sharing files on a Local Area Network (LAN).  The protocol allows a client to manipulate files just as if they were on the local computer.  Operations such as read, write, create, delete, and rename are all supported &#45; the only difference being that the files are not on the local computer and are actually on a remote server.
<p> The CIFS protocol works by sending packets from the client to the server.  Each packet is typically a basic request of some kind, such as open file, close file, or read file.  The server then receives the packet, checks to see if the request is legal, verifies the client has the appropriate file permissions, and finally executes the request and returns a response packet to the client.  The client then parses the response packet and can determine whether or not the initial request was successful.</p>
<p> The CIFS protocol is most commonly used with Microsoft operating systems.  Windows For Workgroups was the first Microsoft operating system to use CIFS, and each Microsoft operating system since then has been able to function as both a CIFS server and client.</p>
