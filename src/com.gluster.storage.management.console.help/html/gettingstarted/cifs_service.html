<h1>CIFS Services</h1>
The Common Internet File System (CIFS), also known as Server Message
Block (SMB), is a network protocol whose most common use is sharing
files on a Local Area Network (LAN). It operates as an application-layer network protocol to provide shared access to files, printers, serial ports, and miscellaneous communications between nodes on a network. It also provides an authenticated inter-process communication mechanism. Most usage of SMB involves computers running Microsoft Windows operating system.

<p>CIFS can be used as an access protocol by Microsoft Windows users to access files in a GlusterFS volume. Users will be able to perform regular file system operations such as creating files, read/write data to files, deletion of data through CIFS.</p>

<h2>Configuring the CIFS Service</h2>
<p>To configure CIFS, you must create a text file consisting of a list of servers (hostnames or IP addresses).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You can configure CIFS on a fresh install or on an existing installation on the server which you have installed Gluster Management Gateway after adding the server to the cluster.</p>
<p>Run the following command on the gateway server to configure CIFS:</p>
<p><FONT FACE = "Courier">$ grun.py &lt;server list&gt;.txt setup_cifs_config.py</FONT></p>
<h2>Creating CIFS Users</h2>
<p>You must create users and their password to enable them to use the CIFS access protocol.</p>
<p>To create CIFS users, run the following on the gateway server:</p>
<p><FONT FACE = "Courier">$ add_user_cifs_all.py &lt;server list&gt; &lt;user list&gt; &lt;password&gt;</FONT></p>
<h2>Removing CIFS Users</h2>
<p>You can delete users and their password.</p>
<p>To delete CIFS users, run the following on the gateway server:</p>
<p><FONT FACE = "Courier">$ delete_user_cifs_all.py &lt;server list&gt; &lt;user list&gt;</FONT></p>
