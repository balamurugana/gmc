<h1>Managing Volumes</h1>
<p>A volume is a logical collection of bricks where each brick is an
export directory on a server in the trusted storage pool. Most of the
Gluster management operations happen on the volume. The volume is the
designated unit of administration in GlusterFS, so managing them is a
large part of the administrator's duties. This section explains how to
manage the volumes stored on file server machines.
<p>You can use Volumes to do the following:
<ul>
	<li> Create and start a new volume (featuring a single global
	namespace)</li>
	<li>Start a volume that is currently stopped</li>
	<li>Stop a volume that is currently running</li>
	<li>Migrate a volume</li>
	<li>Delete a volume from your storage environment</li>
</ul>
<h2>Volume Summary</h2>
<p>The console also enables you to monitor the volumes in your cluster from the <b>Summary</b> tab. To display the summary of your volumes,
click the Volume node from the left pane of the console window. The summary of the volumes is displayed in the right pane of the console
window. It also displays <B>Tasks</B> and <B>Alerts</B> of all the volumes.

<p><b>Types of Volumes</b></p>
<p>Volumes of the following types can be created in your storage
environment:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plain Distributed - Distributes files throughout the bricks in
	the volume.
	<li>Distributed Striped - Distributes data across striped bricks
	in the volume.
	<li>Distributed Mirror - Creates a mirrored volume with all files
	replicated.
	<p><b>Note:</b> You must have at least two servers to activate this
	feature.</p>
</ul>
