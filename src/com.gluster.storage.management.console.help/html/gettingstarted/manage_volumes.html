<h1>Managing Volumes</h1>
 <p>A volume is a logical collection of bricks where each brick is an export directory on a server in the trusted storage pool. Most of the Gluster management operations happen on the volume. The volume is the designated unit of administration in GlusterFS, so managing them is a large part of the administrator's duties. This section explains how to manage the volumes stored on file server machines.<p>You can use Volumes to do the following:<ul>
<li>Create and start a new volume (featuring a single global namespace)
</li><li>Start a volume that is currently stopped
 </li><li>Stop a volume that is currently running
 </li><li>Migrate a volume
 </li><li>Delete a volume from your storage environment </li></ul>
