<h1>Common Cluster Terminologies</h1>
<p><b>Cluster</b></p>
<p>A cluster is a group of linked computers, working together closely thus in many respects forming a single computer.</p>
<p><b>Brick</b>
<p>Brick is the basic unit of storage, represented by an export directory on a server in the trusted storage pool.</p>
<p><b>Network</b></p>
<p>A network is a collection of interconnected computers able to
communicate with each other and transfer information back and forth.</p>
<p><b>Distributed File Systems</b></p>
<p>A file system is a collection of files and the facilities
(programs and commands) that enable users to access the information in
the files. All computing environments have file systems. A distributed
file system takes advantage of the interconnected nature of the network
by storing files on more than one computer in the network and making
them accessible to all of them. In other words, the responsibility for
file storage and delivery is "distributed" among multiple machines
instead of relying on only one.</p>
<p><b>File Server Machines</b></p>
<p>File server machines store the files in the distributed file
system, and a server process running on the file server machine delivers
and receives files.</p>
<p><b>Volumes</b></p>
<p>A volume is a conceptual container for a set of related files
that keeps them all together on one file server machine partition.
Volumes can vary in size, but are (by definition) smaller than a
partition. You can maintain maximum system efficiency by moving volumes
to keep the load balanced evenly among the different machines. If a
partition becomes full, the small size of individual volumes makes it
easy to find enough room on other machines for them. Each volume
corresponds logically to a directory in the file tree and keeps
together, on a single partition, all the data that makes up the files in
the directory (including possible subdirectories). By maintaining (for
example) a separate volume for each user's home directory, you keep all
of the user's files together, but separate from those of other users.
This is an administrative convenience that is impossible if the
partition is the smallest unit of storage.</p>
