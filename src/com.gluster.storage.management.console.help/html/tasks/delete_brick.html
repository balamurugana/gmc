<h1>Remove Brick</h1>
You can shrink volumes, as needed, while the cluster is online and
available. For example, you might need to remove a brick that has become
inaccessible in a distributed volume due to hardware or network failure.
<p><b>Note:</b> Data residing on the brick that you are removing
will no longer be accessible; only the configuration information is
removed - you can continue to access the data directly from the brick,
as necessary.
<p>To remove bricks from an existing volume, perform the following
steps.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choose from the menu, toolbar, or right click and select the
	Volume and select <b>Remove Bricks</b>.
	<li>If the volume is currently running, you are asked to confirm
	before deleting a brick.

	<li>If you wish to remove the brick permanently, click <b>Remove
	Bricks, Delete Data</b>.
	<li>If you wish to keep the data but remove the brick, click <b>Remove
	Bricks, Keep Data</b>.
	<p>The <b>Remove Brick from Volume</b> window is displayed indicating that the
	volume was deleted successfully.</p>
