<h1>Delete a Brick</h1>
You can shrink volumes, as needed, while the cluster is online and available. For example, you might need to remove a brick that has become inaccessible in a distributed volume due to hardware or network failure.
<p><b>Note:</b> Data residing on the brick that you are removing will no longer be accessible; only the configuration information is removed - you can continue to access the data directly from the brick, as necessary. 
<p>To delete bricks from an existing volume, perform the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose from the menu, toolbar, or right click and select the Volume and select <b>Delete Bricks</b>.
<li>If the volume is currently running, you are asked to confirm before deleting a brick.

<li>If you wish to keep the data but delete the brick, click <b>Remove Bricks, Keep Data</b>.
<p>The <b>Delete Brick</b> window is displayed indicating that the volume was deleted successfully.</p>
