<h1>Stopping  Volumes</h1>
You can stop volumes, as needed, while the server is online and available. For example, you might need to remove a brick that has become inaccessible in a distributed volume due to hardware or network failure.
<p> To stop a volume, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choose from the menu, toolbar, or right click to select the volume. Select Stop Volume. 
	<p>If the volume is currently running, you are asked to confirm before stopping a volume.</p>

	<li>Select Yes to stop the Volume. 
	<p>The Stop Volume window appears indicating that the volume was successfully stopped.</p>

	<p>If you have selected multiple volumes, the Stop Volume window appears indicating the volumes were stopped successfully.</p>
	<p><img src="../images/Stop_Vol_multiple_confirm.jpg" alt="Stop Multiple Volumes"/></p>
	<li> Click OK.
</ol>
